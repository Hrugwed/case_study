# note
The original project specification included a Flask (Python) API endpoint.
Since I am more familiar with Node.js and the MERN stack, I rewrote the Part 1 case study in Express.js with MongoDB(using ChatGpt) then made the fixes in the code on my own.
This allowed me to fully understand the logic, debug potential issues, and implement features like SKU uniqueness, decimal price handling, and inventory creation.


# case_study
You're joining a team building "StockFlow" - a B2B inventory management platform. Small businesses use it to track products across multiple warehouses and manage supplier relationships.
