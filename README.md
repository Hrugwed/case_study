# note
The original project specification included a Flask (Python) API endpoint.
Since I am more familiar with Node.js and the MERN stack, I rewrote the Part 1 case study in Express.js with MongoDB(using ChatGpt) then made the fixes in the code on my own.
This allowed me to fully understand the logic, debug potential issues, and implement features like checking SKU uniqueness, decimal price handling, and inventory creation,startTransaction and abortTransaction concepts.


# case_study
You're joining a team building "StockFlow" - a B2B inventory management platform. Small businesses use it to track products across multiple warehouses and manage supplier relationships.

# part 1 case study 
I was confused as the original code was in Flash and i rewrote it in express.js so to explain my process i wrote comments directly in the code it self to make it easy to understand.
